Predicting Bike Sharing Patterns
It's a deep learning project I built a neural network from scratch on a real dataset.

# INSTALLATION
For best experience with managing dependency I advise you install Anconda or miniconda.

# Good to know:
1. Backpropagation and activation function is fundamental to deep learning. 
2. Ensure you have numpy, matplotlib, pandas, and jupyter notebook installed
